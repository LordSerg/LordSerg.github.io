                <hr style="width:20%;text-align:center;">
	            <p>There were a few unsteganographic assumptions:</p>
	            <p><b>(1)</b> In the first part of the video there is a sound, after that there is just a sequence of pictures without it, which means that I can compare individual pictures and the sounds that were with them. So the code for the second part of the video is such that each picture corresponds to the sound of the answer</p>
	            <p><b>(2)</b> Open mouth = 1, closed mouth = 0; Ð¡ompose the answer in binary form from zeros and ones and convert it to UTF-8</p>
	            <p><b>(3)</b> As an assumption<b>(2)</b>, but now we pay attention to the interval: some pictures have long durations, the others have short one. Let's say we will look at the image every 0.1 seconds and record a binary pair. The longer the same image goes, the more times we will record the same binary pair</p>
	            <p><b>(4)</b> If all of the above ideas are failed - I can always use some steganography magic</p>
	            <p>------</p>
	            <p>The <b>(1)</b>st idea gave nothing but some spooky noises, so that idea goes to trash bin.</p>
	            <p><b>(2)</b>nd idea gave me some hope until i realised that there were only 63 different frames!</p>
	            <p>Which leads to 126 pares.</p>
	            <p>And knowing full well that each character consists of 8 bits we get to the conclusion that there are not enough cat pictures.</p>
	            <p>But anyway I gave this result a try and got this using online [<a href="https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/binary-to-ascii.html">bin to text</a>] converter:</p>
                <div style="text-align: center;">
	                <p>
	                <picture>
		                <source media="(min-width:650px)" src="Sikorsky/TalkingCats/talk1.jpg">
		                <img src="Sikorsky/TalkingCats/talk1.jpg" alt="first attempt" style="width:auto;object-fit:contain;">
	                </picture>
	                </p>
                </div>
	            <p>Great! We got the first letter correct!</p>
	            <p>Now the question is: timing. How long should be time interval  to look at a cat picture?</p>
	            <p>Using some video editor i splitted the second part of the video in such way that every other different frame has a visible duration time. The point was to see, how random these intervals of each frame:</p>
                <div style="text-align: center;">
	                <p>
		                <img src="Sikorsky/TalkingCats/talk2.jpg" alt="video dividing" style="object-fit:scale-down;max-width:auto;height:auto;">
                    </p>
                </div>
	            <p>Here I noticed that there were only three types of delay:</p>
	            <ul>
		            <li>1/3 of a second</li>
		            <li>2/3 of a second</li>
		            <li>3/3 of a second</li>
	            </ul>
	            <p>Great! Now assuming that the shortest duration is 1/3 second I got to the idea that I should look at the frame every 1/3 seconds.</p>
	            <p>Doing calculations:</p>
	            <p>Now I have 76 binary pares which is 152 bits = 19 characters</p>
	            <p>Perfect:</p>
